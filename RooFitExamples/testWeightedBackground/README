Using weighted RooHSEventsPDFs
e.g. subtract random time coincidences from empty target data and use this
to fit the signal and background
e.g. also can be used to shape simulated events, such as add t-distribution to
  phase space events to get the correct missing mass shape.

Create data and MC trees
  root 'ModelTime.C( "Data.root" )'
MC trees are named SigData.root and BGData.root
The data and background tree include random time coincidences, while the signal
tree is pure signal shapes.
We would like to subtract the random events from the data and background
before tryubg to fit the data with the signal and background PDFs

sPlot random subtraction of data
  root --hsfit FitHSDataTime.C

sPlot random subtraction of background
  root --hsfit FitHSBGTime.C

sPlot discrimination on missing mass with data and the background PDF shape
random subtracted
  root --hsfit FitHSMCModel.C

You can also check the effect of not performing the random subtraction on the
background PDF by removing the line
 // pdfb->LoadWeights("TimeCoinc","outBGTime/binFitTweights.root","HSsWeights");

Notice even although the fit to the missing mass is not great the weighted
M1 and M2 distributions look fine. Why is that?

Such background subtractions can also be performed with sidebands.
This is demonstrated in FitHSMCModelSideBand.C
Here the THSWeights::WeightBySelection function is used to generate a
THSWeight obect associated with  the chains using sideband weights
(ratio of timing window ranges).
WeightBySelection requires a tree, a selection to test on which events
to  apply the weight, and a value for the weight that will be set
This can be run multiple times on the same tree allowing you to set
different weights for random and prompt timing in this example.

Nore there seems to be a random seg fault in WeightBySelection when calling SetEntryList
Please report this to dglazier if you reproduce this issue.
